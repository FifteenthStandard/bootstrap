    When I was about ten, I was first introduced to computer programming via a
    program called Game Maker, which does what it says on the tin. After making
    a few simple games, I was struck with a question that left me perplexed for
    years:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      If I need to use a program to make other programs, how was the first
      program made?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Most compilers for common programming languages are written in the language
    which they compile. The text editors that we use to write programs are
    themselves programs with source code which was written with a text editor.
    These programs execute thanks to an operating system, which itself is yet
    another program, built with a compiler, written in a text editor, running
    on an operating system. The physical hardware of a computer is so complex
    that it is designed with a program and manufactured by machinery, both
    running thanks to other computers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dependencies between all these layers form intricate cycles with no
    obvious starting point, but at some point, there must have been a first.
    The first compiler written without a compiler. The first text editor
    written without a text editor. The first operating system written without
    an operating system. The first computer built without a computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    This process is called <em>bootstrapping</em>, and the goal of this guide
    is to understand how it works.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than building each layer of this stack individually in its entirety
    before moving up to the next layer, we will instead develop them in small
    iterative steps, frequently moving up and down the layers. This will
    mimic the way that hardware and software advances were made throughout
    history and show that there are many ways to implement most functions of a
    computer, highlighting the advantages that different implementations have.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will start the journey with the electron and basic electrical circuits,
    with components like voltage sources, resistors, inductors, capacitors, and
    transistors. We&rsquo;ll learn how these components can be combined to make
    other, more useful components called logic gates, which let us control the
    flow of current through the circuit in more sophisticated ways. With enough
    of these components, we get our hardware layer&mdash;a fairly basic 16-bit
    computer with 64KiB of RAM, a further 64KiB of storage, a 640&Cross;480
    pixel monochrome display, and a keyboard, as well as some other devices
    that will be useful for manual data entry like a keypunch and punched card
    reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    To allow us to run different programs on our computer, like a text editor,
    a compiler, and any other programs we write, as well as to provide our
    programs with useful functionality like displaying text on the screen and
    reading and writing files to storage, we will create an operating system.
    Since we won&rsquo;t have a text editor or a compiler when we start
    developing our operating system, we will have to start developing it in raw
    machine code using a keypunch, as that requires no software to run. We can
    then build up enough functionality to allow us to develop more useful tools
    for developing the operating system itself, like an assembler, which
    translates human-readable assembly language into the binary machine code
    stored in our computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    As our operating system gets more capable, we can use it to run our text
    editor and compiler, which we will use to&hellip; develop our text editor
    and compiler. These will both start out with an extremely limited set of
    functionalities&mdash;whatever we were able to implement by hand&mdash;and
    will grow rapidly as we add more features to make them powerful enough to
    add yet more features until finally, they are fully self-contained. This
    means our compiler will need to support reading its own source code from a
    text file, processing the text, translating it into machine instructions,
    and creating a binary file which can be executed by the computer.

    We&rsquo;re going to start at the very bottom: electricity and the
    fundamental laws of electrical circuits. This is an entire field of study
    in itself and we will very quickly move up one layer of abstraction so that
    we don&rsquo;t really need to think too much about this, but I think
    it&rsquo;s worth at least trying to understand how things work at this
    level, so this is where we&rsquo;ll start. We&rsquo;ll explore some
    important concepts by building an electrical circuit together, adding
    components one at a time and explaining what they do, how they work, and
    why they are required, as we go.
  </p>
  <p>
    The starting point for our circuit is a 9V battery with its two terminals
    connected by a piece of copper wire. In terms of function, this is an
    extremely boring circuit&mdash;about the only thing it will do is drain the
    battery, heat it up, and destroy it, so please don&rsquo;t do
    this&mdash;but already it suggests some interesting questions whose answers
    explain the fundamentals of electricity. What is a battery? What do its two
    terminals do? Why will it drain the battery? Drain it of what exactly? Why
    a copper wire? Let&rsquo;s dive in.
  </p>

    Electromagnetism is one of the fundamental forces of nature and is what
    causes electrons and protons to be attracted to each other, electrons to
    repel other electrons and likewise protons to repel other protons.
    Electrons and protons are called charge carriers, and we arbitrarily call
    protons positive charge carriers and electrons negative charge carriers. In
    their default state, atoms of any pure element have the same number of
    protons as electrons and are neutrally charged. Although protons are
    trapped within the nucleus of an atom, electrons orbit around the nucleus
    at various distances and can escape their orbit and move to neighbouring
    atoms. When an atom loses an electron, it will have more protons than
    electrons and so become positively charged&mdash;it will be more attractive
    to wandering electrons than a neutrally charged atom. Conversely, the atom
    which gained an electron becomes negatively charged&mdash;it will be less
    attractive to wandering electrons than a neutrally charged atom. When many
    similarly charged atoms build up close together, we call this a build-up of
    electrical charge.
  </p>
  <p>
    A battery is something which purposely creates a build-up of positive and
    negative charge. Within the battery there is a chemical reaction called
    oxidation which causes electrons to be released from some atoms, creating a
    steady source of free electrons at one of its terminals, which we call the
    negative terminal or anode. There is another chemical reaction called
    reduction which absorbs free electrons, creating a steady consumer of free
    electrons at its other terminal, called the positive terminal or cathode.
    The difference in charge between these two terminals creates electrical
    potential which we call <em>voltage</em> or voltage differential. Because a
    battery creates voltage, we call it a voltage source. When the terminals
    are connected, electrons are pushed out of the anode, through the circuit,
    and attracted back into the cathode, where another chemical process
    transfers electrons back to the anode to complete the cycle. This flow of
    electrons is called <em>current</em>. Although the electrons flow from the
    negative terminal to the positive, for historical reasons current is
    defined as flowing from positive to negative.
  </p>
  <p>
    The specifics of these chemical reactions vary depending on the type of
    battery, and other voltage sources like a power outlet connected to mains
    electricity use completely different mechanisms for creating voltage
    differences, so we won&rsquo;t go any deeper into these. The important
    thing is that a voltage source has two terminals, one a source of electrons
    and the other a consumer of electrons, and the difference in charge between
    these two terminals creates a difference in electrical potential which can
    drive current through a circuit. Since voltage differences must always be
    measured between two points, by convention one of these points is usually
    the negative terminal of the battery. Since the negative terminal has no
    voltage difference with itself, we define it to be zero volts (0V), and we
    often refer to this as <em>ground</em>.
  <p>
    When we connect the two terminals together to form a loop, we create a
    <em>closed</em> electrical circuit through which current can flow (if there
    are no continuous loops connecting the two terminals, we call it an
    <em>open</em> circuit and current won&rsquo;t flow). The amount of current
    depends on the conductivity, or conversely on the resistance, of the
    material in the circuit. In our example, we used copper wire. Copper is a
    particularly good conductor of electricity, which means that it provides
    little resistance. The reason copper is so good at conducting electricity
    is that one of the electrons within an atom of copper orbits the nucleus at
    such a great (relative) distance that the attractive force is very weak,
    the electron is said to be loosely bound to the nucleus, and can escape to
    neighbouring copper atoms. Because of this, we call copper a conductor.
    Other materials, like some carbon compounds, have pockets with loosely
    bound free electrons as well as pockets with no free electrons, making it
    harder for electrons to pass through the material as quickly. We call these
    materials resistors. Others, like glass, have very tightly bound electrons
    which make it almost impossible for free electrons to pass, and are called
    insulators.
  </p>
  <p>
    One common analogy for all of this is to think about water flowing through
    pipes. There are a few caveats we need to be careful with, but overall,
    this is a useful mental model. The first thing to note is that we should
    only imagine water which flows through pipes at pressure, like the supply
    pipes which carry mains pressure water from the street to your taps,
    shower, and other fixtures. Drainpipes, which flow mostly because of
    gravity, behave very differently from electrical circuits, so we need to
    make sure we aren&rsquo;t picturing them in our heads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pressurised pipes work because at all times they are full of water, and you
    can force the flow of water within the pipes by pushing water in at one end
    with a pump of sufficient pressure, or by sucking water out at the other
    end with a sufficient vacuum force (the opposite of pressure). Any
    combination of these two forces creates a pressure difference which causes
    water to flow from one end to the other. Without an infinite supply of
    water at the inlet, the flow will stop&mdash;or similarly without an
    infinite tank at the outlet for the water to drain into, the pressure at
    the outlet will match the pressure at the inlet and the flow will stop. If
    the outlet is connected back to the inlet, the water can be recycled and
    fed back into the pipes to create a continuous flow of water.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a drop of water enters at one end of a pipe, it pushes another drop
    forward, which pushes another drop forward, and so on until a drop at the
    other end is pushed out of the pipe back into the pump to start the cycle
    again&mdash;or conversely when one drop leaks out at the end, its place is
    immediately filled by a drop behind it, whose space is immediately filled
    by another drop behind it, and so on until a drop at the start is pulled
    into the pipe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the pipes are always full and the flow of water is caused by this
    push and pull of water drops, the rate of flow is the same at all points in
    the pipe, except where there are junctions. If there are junctions, the
    water flowing into a junction will get distributed across the branches
    proportional to the amount of resistance of each branch&mdash;the amount of
    water flowing into any junction is always the same as the amount of water
    flowing out. This is true for current in a circuit too, with electrons
    corresponding to drops of water (although electrons don&rsquo;t physically
    bump into each other, when one moves forward it leaves a gap behind it for
    another to fill).
  </p>
  <p>
    This property, that inbound and outbound flow into a junction is always the
    same, is called <em>Kirchhoff&rsquo;s current law</em> (KCL).
  </p>
  <p>
    When water hits a bottleneck, we usually think of a build-up of water and
    hence a build-up of pressure but recall that the pipes are already full,
    and the water is already at pressure. Instead, the important part to
    consider is that because the bottleneck is limiting the amount of flow,
    there is a higher potential for flow upstream of the bottleneck than what
    is being allowed to flow through to the downstream region, and hence the
    pressure is proportionally lowered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within a loop of a circuit, as voltage drops through each resisting
    section, eventually it will reach the that of ground&mdash;the negative
    terminal of the battery or the pump that completes the loop in our pipe. If
    the voltage did not eventually drop to ground, it would imply that the
    there is still an excess of voltage differential in the circuit and that it
    should be capable of driving more current, which would just drop more
    voltage over each resistance point until eventually it stabilises to ground
    and no more current can be driven.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other way of thinking about this is to start with zero current and
    consider what happens as the initial voltage differential from the voltage
    source drives an increasing amount of current through the circuit. With no
    current, there is the full differential supplied by the voltage source
    which will start to drive current. As the current moves through the
    circuit and crosses a resistance point, some voltage will be lost
    based on the strength of the resistor and the amount of current that is
    flowing, initially a small amount. This means that there will still be a
    significant voltage differential between the last part of the circuit and
    the negative terminal of the voltage source, which will increase the
    current a bit more. Since the increase of incoming current needs to be
    matched by an increase in outgoing current, current across the entire
    circuit will increase by a small amount, which will result in a further
    small voltage drop across every resistance point. Eventually enough voltage
    will drop that there is no longer any difference between the last part of
    the circuit and the negative terminal, and finally the current will
    stabilise.
  </p>
  <p>
    This property, that all components in a loop of a circuit combined will
    drop the same amount of voltage as what is provided by the voltage source,
    is called <em>Kirchhoff&rsquo;s voltage law</em> (KVL).
  </p>
  <p>
    The rate of flow through a pipe is determined by the size of the pressure
    differential and the size of the pipes. The pressure corresponds to voltage
    and the size of the pipe corresponds to the conductivity of the materials
    in the circuit&mdash;bigger pipes allow more water to flow, whereas smaller
    pipes act like resistors and limit the amount of flow. Note that this means
    that the <em>speed</em> of flow might not be the same at all points, but
    the <em>rate</em> of flow will be&mdash;the volume of water moved per
    second through any cross-section of the pipe. In areas with wider pipes, a
    larger amount of water can flow at a lower speed and still have the same
    rate of flow as a smaller amount of water flowing through a smaller pipe at
    greater speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    This relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is called
    <em>Ohm&rsquo;s law</em>, and it states that
  </p>
  <figure>
    <math display="block">
      <mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>R</mi>
    </math>
  </figure>
  <p>
    where <em>V</em> is the voltage difference (in volts, V) from one side of a
    component to the other, <em>I</em> is the amount of current flowing through
    the component (measured in amperes or amps, A), and <em>R</em> is the
    resistance of the component (measured in ohms, &Omega;). Note that
    <em>V</em> is the voltage difference between each side, or said another
    way, the voltage drop across the component, <em>not</em> the voltage
    supplied to the &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; side of the component. The voltage
    drop depends on the current flowing through the circuit and the resistance
    of the component. When analysing an entire circuit, we can&rsquo;t just
    start with the voltage available to the first component and solve for each
    component individually in order&mdash;we need to consider how much current
    the circuit as a whole will allow and then we can calculate how much
    voltage will drop across each component based on its resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is going to sound a bit cyclical, but the total current of the circuit
    will depend on the current permitted by each component, so we can rearrange
    the equation to tell us the amount of current that will flow if we already
    know the voltage and resistance,
  </p>
  <figure>
    <math display="block">
      <mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>V</mi><mi>R</mi></mfrac>
    </math>
  </figure>
  <p>
    So how can we use these equations to analyse the behaviour of our circuit?
    In general, this can be a tricky question to answer, but in practice there
    are a few tricks we can use to make this straightforward. We&rsquo;ll
    introduce these tricks as our circuit gets increasingly complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, our circuit only has two components: the battery and the copper
    wire. Both have extremely small resistances&mdash;copper has about
    0.02&Omega; and the internal resistance of a 9V battery is about 1&Omega;.
    This means that the combined resistance in the circuit is still about
    1&Omega; and that a 9V battery would drive about 9A of current&mdash;far
    more than the safe level for a battery, which is typically about 200mA
    (0.2A).
  </p>
  <p>
    To make our circuit safe, we need to add a resistor to limit the amount of
    current. We&rsquo;ll aim for 50mA (0.05A), which is about how much current
    most useful components need to function. There is one more arrangement of
    Ohm&rsquo;s law which can help us find a suitable resistor,
  </p>
  <figure>
    <math display="block">
      <mi>R</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>V</mi><mi>I</mi></mfrac>
    </math>
  </figure>
  <p>
    With a 9V battery and 50mA (0.05A) of current, we would need a total
    resistance of 180&Omega;. If we add a resistor of this size, the resistance
    of the copper and the internal resistance of the battery become negligible
    (less than 1% of the total resistance) so we can safely ignore them. One
    other point worth mentioning is that in this circuit, the resistor will
    drop the entire 9V available, so if we were to measure the voltage between
    the wire before the resistor and ground we would get the full 9V, and
    between the wire after the resistor and ground we get 0V.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we have a circuit that safely draws a consistent 50mA of current,
    we can start adding more components to it to do something useful. The first
    such component we&rsquo;ll look at is an LED (light-emitting diode), so
    that we can see that our circuit is doing something. But first we need to
    understand how an LED works and what a diode is.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="imgs/c01/battery-resistor-diode.png">
    <figcaption>
      Our circuit, with voltage supply on the left, and resistor and diode on the
      right
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    A diode is a component which only allows current to flow in a single
    direction and requires a certain amount of voltage to allow any current at
    all. How does this work? Diodes are made of materials called
    <em>semiconductors</em>, which behave somewhere between a conductor and an
    insulator, the most common such material being silicon. Pure silicon is a
    weak conductor, but when a tiny amount of impurity is introduced, by the
    addition of a few atoms of another material, its conductive properties
    change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Silicon has four electrons in its <em>valence band</em>, the part of the
    atom which bonds it together with neighbouring atoms. Phosphorous is very
    similar to silicon but has one extra electron in its valence band, so when
    a trace amount of phosphorous is added to a pure silicon crystal, four of
    the electrons in its valence band bind it with neighbouring silicon atoms,
    and one of them becomes a free electron which can roam around and conduct a
    small electrical current. Conversely, boron is similar to silicon but in
    the opposite way&mdash;it has one fewer electron in its valence band, and
    behaves a little like a silicon atom with a hole in it, which nearby
    free electrons might jump into, leaving behind a hole that other free
    electrons might jump into, hence conducting electrical current. Note that
    in both cases, the individual atoms still have the same number of protons
    and electrons&mdash;they are not naturally charged one way or the other,
    the movement is purely random.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you join two silicon crystals with these slight impurities in them,
    one with some phosphorous and one with some boron, something interesting
    happens. At the junction of the two pieces, the free electrons in the
    phosphorous-infused silicon are attracted to the holes in the boron-infused
    silicon, creating something called a <em>depletion region</em>. Within the
    depletion region, all the free electrons from the phosphorous atoms have
    found a free hole in the boron atoms, and so there are no more free
    electrons and no more holes moving around to conduct electricity&mdash;the
    depletion region acts like an insulator. Within the phosphorous side of the
    depletion region, there are fewer electrons than protons, since some of
    them escaped into the boron, so a small positive charge builds up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the phosphorous is providing the free electrons, we call
    phosphorous-infused silicon an <em>n-type</em> material (for negative).
    Similarly, in the boron side of the depletion region, there are more
    electrons than protons, because of the electrons which were attracted from
    the phosphorous on the other side of the junction, so a small negative
    charge builds up. Because the boron is providing the holes for the
    electrons to move into, we call boron-infused silicon a <em>p-type</em>
    material (for positive). When the voltage difference between the two sides
    is zero, we call this <em>zero biasing</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It gets more interesting when you apply a voltage differential to each
    side of the combined crystal. If you apply a higher voltage to the p-type
    side than to the n-type side, electrons will flow through the n-type
    material until they reach the depletion region, which is positively charged
    and will attract the electrons. Similarly on the other side, free electrons
    in the p-type material will be attracted to the voltage source, causing a
    migration of electrons through the material all the way back to its side of
    the depletion region, which is negatively charged and has an excess of
    electrons. These combined forces will shrink the depletion region to the
    point that electrons coming in from the n-type material can cross over to
    the p-type material, and the crystal will conduct current. We call this
    <em>forward biasing</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do the opposite&mdash;apply a higher voltage to the n-type side than
    to the p-type side&mdash;the opposite will happen. Electrons in the n-type
    material will be attracted out of the crystal to the voltage source,
    creating an even stronger positive charge in the n-type material, and
    electrons entering the p-type material will be repelled by the existing
    negative charge in the depletion region, creating an even stronger negative
    charge. The depletion region will only get bigger, creating an even
    stronger insulator, and preventing any current from flowing. We call this
    <em>reverse biasing</em>.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="imgs/c01/diode.png">
    <figcaption>
      A diode subjected to different voltage differentials
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Above are four depictions of a diode. In the top-left is a diode
    immediately at the point that the p-type and n-type material are joined
    together. Some free electrons in the n-type material can jump across the
    junction to holes in the p-type material. In the top-right, once this
    electron movement has taken place, we can see the depletion region in the
    middle. Applying the same voltage to both sides (by connecting them
    together) leaves the depletion region intact. In the bottom-left, applying
    high voltage to the p-type material and low voltage to the n-type material
    shrinks the depletion region and allows current to flow. In the
    bottom-right, applying low voltage to the p-type material and high voltage
    to the n-type material expands the depletion region, further preventing
    current.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two important properties that come from this behaviour, which we
    alluded to earlier. First, that diodes will only conduct current in one
    direction and not the other. Most materials will conduct electricity in
    any direction, depending on which side has the higher voltage&mdash;current
    will always flow from areas of high voltage to areas of low voltage, much
    like how water can flow through a pipe in either direction but will always
    flow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Diodes can be
    used to control how current flows through a circuit by limiting direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, diodes don&rsquo;t have constant resistance. When a low voltage is
    applied to the p-type side, the depletion region remains intact and no
    current will flow, which gives the component a high effective resistance.
    Once a certain amount of voltage is applied (called the <em>forward
    voltage</em>), the depletion region will shrink and allow current to flow.
    In this state, the silicon crystal is extremely conductive, providing
    little resistance to current. This means that a diode will drop little
    voltage beyond its forward voltage, since voltage drop is proportional to
    resistance. This also means that when we are analysing the behaviour of a
    circuit, we won&rsquo;t apply Ohm&rsquo;s law when determining the voltage
    drop across a diode&mdash;its resistance is not constant, its usually
    unknown, and not really worth trying to calculate since we know that the
    diode will just drop its forward current and essentially nothing else
    anyway.

  <p>
    Getting back to our circuit, if we want to add an LED there are a few
    attributes we need to know: its forward voltage and its preferred current.
    LEDs get brighter as much current flows through them, up to a preferred
    maximum current where they operate at full brightness. A small amount of
    current above this is merely wasteful, a large current above this could
    damage the LED, so it&rsquo;s best to stick to the preferred current. A
    typical red LED has a forward voltage of 2V and a preferred current of
    20mA. With these details, we can add an LED to our circuit and adjust our
    resistor to suit. With 9V available and 2V which we expect to drop across
    our LED, we need a resistor which will allow 20mA of current and drop 7V in
    the process. Using Ohm&rsquo;s law, we get
    <math>
      <mfrac>
        <mrow><mn>7</mn><mi>V</mi></mrow>
        <mrow><mn>0.02</mn><mi>A</mi></mrow>
      </mfrac>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mn>350</mn><mi>&Omega;</mi>
    </math>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So where do we put the LED, before the resistor or after? In this case, it
    doesn&rsquo;t matter. Although the resistor limits current, recall that the
    current will be the same at all points in our circuit, so even a
    current-limiting resistor after our LED will be safe. Since it
    doesn&rsquo;t matter where the LED goes, we will arbitrarily decide to
    place the resistor before the LED so that it&rsquo;s easier to read a
    circuit diagram in order and immediately know that the LED is protected.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we&rsquo;re at it, we can also easily calculate the voltage to ground
    at various points across our circuit. If we put the LED before the
    resistor, the wire before the LED will be at 9V, the LED will then drop 2V,
    the wire between the LED and the resistor will therefore be at 7V, the
    resistor will drop a further 7V, and the wire after the resistor will be at
    0V. If we had instead put the LED after the resistor, the wire between the
    resistor and the LED would be at 2V since it comes after the 7V drop of the
    resistor and before the 2V drop of the LED.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, there we have our first basic somewhat-useful circuit. We&rsquo;ve had
    to explore quite a lot about the basics of electricity to get here, so
    hopefully at least some of it made sense. Some of what we discussed
    wasn&rsquo;t relevant for our circuit, so we&rsquo;ll cover it again as we
    continue to add more components to our circuit, and they become more
    important and clearer by example.

  <p>
    The main takeaways from this chapter are that a circuit will drive as much
    current as it can, limited by the resistance of its components, some of
    which (like resistors) have a fixed amount of resistance and others (like
    diodes) have voltage-dependent resistance. Through each junction in a
    circuit, the current flowing in will perfectly balance with the current
    flowing out, and through each closed loop in a circuit, the voltage dropped
    across each component will perfectly balance with what is provided by the
    voltage supply.
